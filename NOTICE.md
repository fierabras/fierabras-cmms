## Origin and original copyright

This software is a **fork of Atlas CMMS** maintained at
<https://github.com/Grashjs/cmms> by INTELLOOP LLC. All original copyright,
trademark, and other notices are preserved. This fork is distributed

## Status

- **Unofficial** community fork. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
  sponsored by INTELLOOP LLC or Grashjs.
- **Date of modification:** 2026-08.
- **License of the fork:** AGPL-3.0-only.

## Summary of changes

1. Added a local, deterministic AGPL licensing policy in
   `api/src/main/java/com/grash/service/LicenseService.java` that grants every
   `LicenseEntitlement` without contacting Keygen or requiring a license key/file.
2. In `api/src/main/java/com/grash/ApplicationInitializer.java`, every persisted
   `SubscriptionPlan` is given all `PlanFeatures` (idempotent upsert), and existing
   subscriptions are normalized to remove commercial seat limits and degradation.
3. In `api/src/main/java/com/grash/service/SubscriptionService.java`,
   `resetToFreePlan` now delegates to an AGPL policy that does not degrade
   subscriptions, preserves the historical plan and `paddleSubscriptionId`,
   and removes pending Quartz degradation jobs.
4. Added a public AGPLv3 corresponding-source endpoint
   `api/src/main/java/com/grash/controller/SourceController.java`
   (`GET /source`, exposed as `/api/source`), permitted in
   `WebSecurityConfig.java` without relaxing any other security rule.
5. Added `SOURCE_CODE_URL` / `SOURCE_REVISION` configuration
   (`application.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `frontend/.env.example`).
6. Added a visible "Código fuente — AGPLv3" link in the frontend
   (`frontend/src/config.ts`, the login screen
   `content/pages/Auth/Login/Cover/index.tsx`, and the authenticated sidebar
   footer `ExtendedSidebarLayout/Sidebar/SidebarFooter/index.tsx`).
7. `docker-compose.yml` now builds local `fierabras/cmms-api:local` and
   `fierabras/cmms-frontend:local` images from this fork's source.
8. Added a fork section in `README.MD` and this `NOTICE.md`.
9. Added contract tests
   (`api/src/test/java/com/grash/service/LicenseServiceTest.java`,
   `api/src/test/java/com/grash/ApplicationInitializerTest.java`, and the
   `ResetToFreePlan` / `ApplyAgplSubscriptionPolicy` / `NormalizeExistingSubscriptions`
   sections of `SubscriptionServiceTest.java`).
